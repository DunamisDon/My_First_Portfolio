            <h3>Network Scanner</h3>
            <p>This project scans networks for threat actors and boots them off a network after injecting them with
                malware that prevents any further connections from that same device with that serial number as well as
                MAC Address.</p>

        <h3>Farmers' Hub</h3>
        <p>Imagine Facebook, but for farmers. Every account is automatically subscribed to the national weather station
            and the agricultural authority such that their feed/wall has weather updates and critical pest and season
            advice. Not forgetting a fully functional marketplace that allows opening bids as well for farming machinery
            and other equipment.</p>
